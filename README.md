# Playground

Playground repository to experiment and learn about different programming concepts. Each concept is covered in a
dedicated source file, which provides implementation and explanation in the comments. All cases are listed below with
a short description.

Clone repository, run files, modify to experiment and run again.

## Algorithms

1. **[rendezvous_hashing_main.py](algorithms/rendezvous_hashing_main.py)** - Rendezvous hashing algo to get consistent
   hashing, see [rendezvous hashing in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing).

## Python

1. **[coroutines_basics_main.py](python_asyncio/coroutines_basics_main.py)** - basic examples and explanation of asyncio
   library.
2. **[producer_consumer_batch_main.py](python_asyncio/producer_consumer_batch_main.py)** - producer and consumer with a
   batch mode, where consumer consumes in batches: waits for X elements but no longer than Y seconds.
