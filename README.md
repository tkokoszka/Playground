# Playground

Playground repository to experiment and learn about different programming concepts. Each concept is covered in a
dedicated source file, which has both the implementation and explanation in the comments. All files are listed here with
a short description.

## Algorithms

1. **[rendezvous_hashing_main.py](algorithms/rendezvous_hashing_main.py)** - Rendezvous hashing algo to get consistent
   hashing, see [rendezvous hashing in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing).

## Python

1. **[asyncio_coroutines.py](python_asyncio/asyncio_coroutines.py)** - basic examples and explanation of asyncio
