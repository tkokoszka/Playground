Playground repository to experiment and learn about different programming concepts. Each concept is covered in a
dedicated source file, which has both the implementation and explanation in the comments. All files are listed here with
a short description.

## Algorithms

1. **[rendezvous_hashing_main.py](algorithms/rendezvous_hashing_main.py)** - a simpler way to achieve similar effect as
   consistent hashing, see [rendezvous hashing in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_hashing).
